This website should be able to allow the user to save their customizations based on the vehicle they want. The current way of the website, i want to probably make it easier
to allow fabrication and customization to their vehicle they want, e.g more seats, captain seats instead of bench seating, heated backseats etc. that way a user can get the 
vehicle for their specific use cases.
